# Apartment, Complex
Repository for the Curious Creations entry for the So Bad It's Good Jam 2024.

You agreed to look after your friend's apartment for a day. You realize as soon as you walk in that you've never been here before and don't know how anything works, so everything feels... alien. Go about the day as well as you can, and be careful not to get overwhelmed by all of the sudden noise. It's just for a day, right?

This game is made as part of the 'So Bad it's Good' Jam 2024.
Controls:

This is a point and click game, use your mouse cursor to click on all the trash in the apartment in order to clean up the room.

Make sure to manage the noisy distractions affecting your score and sanity by clicking on the distracting objects to silence them.
